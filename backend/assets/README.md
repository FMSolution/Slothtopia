# SLOTHTOPIA 

## Assets seperated in directories to render accordingly

Each asset here is rendered from the requests done through *app.py* as the main server



** animations **

> Animations: `.glb` files that render the animation on the playersSloths 
> Avatars: `.glb` files that render each sloth. Since IPFS can be slow in rendering, not sacrificing gameplay by creating API calls to the server
> Cubemaps: `.dds` files that render the wrapped lighting of the Metaverse
> Fonts: `.json` && `.png` the display the font rendering properties
> Metadata: `.json` files that are used via *gameTokenURI* function that returns the same IPFS metadata from the server
> Models: `.glb` files that are commonly used inside the Metaverse, such items are frequently fetched to all players. such as: *auctionHouse*, *chair*
> Scripts: `.js` files that are used to manipulate entities and render functionalities within the Metaverse.
> Textures: `.png` files which render the actual texture of the different objects inside the Metaverse.
